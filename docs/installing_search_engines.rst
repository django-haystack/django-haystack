Solr
====

Official Download Location: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/

Solr is Java but comes in a pre=packaged form that requires very little other
than the JRE and Jetty. It's very performant and has an advanced featureset.
Haystack requires Solr 1.3+. Installation is relatively simple::

    curl -O http://apache.mirrors.tds.net/lucene/solr/1.3.0/apache-solr-1.3.0.tgz
    tar xvzf apache-solr-1.3.0.tgz
    cd apache-solr-1.3.0
    cd example
    java -jar start.jar

You'll need to revise your schema. You can generate this from your application
(once Haystack is installed and setup) by running 
``./manage.py build_solr_schema``. Take the output from that command and place
it in ``apache-solr-1.3.0/example/solr/conf/schema.xml``. Then restart Solr.

You'll also need a Solr binding, ``pysolr``. The official ``pysolr`` package,
distributed via PyPI, is the best version to use (2.0.9+). Place ``pysolr.py``
somewhere on your ``PYTHONPATH``.

.. note::

    ``pysolr`` has it's own dependencies that aren't covered by Haystack. For
    best results, you should have an ElementTree variant install (preferably the
    ``lxml`` variant), ``httplib2`` for timeouts (though it will fall back to
    ``httplib``) and either the ``json`` module that comes with Python 2.5+ or
    ``simplejson``.

More Like This
--------------

To enable the "More Like This" functionality in Haystack, you'll need
to enable the ``MoreLikeThisHandler``. Add the following line to your
``solrconfig.xml`` file within the ``config`` tag::

    <requestHandler name="/mlt" class="solr.MoreLikeThisHandler" />

Spelling Suggestions
--------------------

To enable the spelling suggestion functionality in Haystack, you'll need
to setup the ``MoreLikeThisHandler``. Add the following line to your
``solrconfig.xml`` file within the ``config`` tag::

    <searchComponent name="spellcheck" class="solr.SpellCheckComponent">

        <str name="queryAnalyzerFieldType">textSpell</str>

        <lst name="spellchecker">
          <str name="name">default</str>
          <str name="field">text</str>
          <str name="spellcheckIndexDir">./spellchecker1</str>
          <str name="buildOnCommit">true</str>
        </lst>
    </searchComponent>

Then change your default handler from::

    <requestHandler name="standard" class="solr.StandardRequestHandler" default="true" />

... to ...::

    <requestHandler name="standard" class="solr.StandardRequestHandler" default="true">
        <arr name="last-components">
            <str>spellcheck</str>
        </arr>
    </requestHandler>

Be warned that the ``<str name="field">text</str>`` portion will be specific to
your ``SearchIndex`` classes (in this case, assuming the main field is called
``text``). This should be the same as the ``<defaultSearchField>`` in your
``schema.xml``.


Whoosh
======

Official Download Location: http://whoosh.ca/

Whoosh is pure Python, so it's a great option for getting started quickly and
for development, though it does work for small scale live deployments. With the
0.3.1+ releases, Whoosh has become much more performant, stable and better
tested. The current recommended version is 0.3.15+. You can install via PyPI_
using::

    sudo easy_install whoosh
    # ... or ...
    sudo pip install whoosh

Note that, while capable otherwise, the Whoosh backend does not currently
support "More Like This" or faceting.

Xapian
======

Official Download Location: http://xapian.org/download

Xapian is written in C++ so it requires compilation (unless your OS has a
package for it). Installation looks like::

    curl -O http://oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/1.0.11/xapian-core-1.0.11.tar.gz
    curl -O http://oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/1.0.11/xapian-bindings-1.0.11.tar.gz
    
    tar xvzf xapian-core-1.0.11.tar.gz
    tar xvzf xapian-bindings-1.0.11.tar.gz
    
    cd xapian-core-1.0.11
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    
    cd ..
    cd xapian-bindings-1.0.11
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Xapian is a supported backend but is not included in Haystack proper due to
licensing. You can download the source from
http://github.com/notanumber/xapian-haystack/tree/master. Installation
instructions can be found on that page as well. The backend, written
by David Sauve (notanumber), fully implements the `SearchQuerySet` API and is
an excellent alternative to Solr.
