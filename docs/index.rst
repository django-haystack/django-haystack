Welcome to Haystack!
====================

Haystack provides modular search for Django. It features a unified, familiar
API that allows you to plug in different search backends (such as Solr_,
Elasticsearch_, Whoosh_, Xapian_, etc.) without having to modify your code.

.. _Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
.. _Elasticsearch: http://elasticsearch.org/
.. _Whoosh: https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/
.. _Xapian: http://xapian.org/

Additionally, each backend has its own requirements. You should refer to
:doc:`installing_search_engines` for more details.
