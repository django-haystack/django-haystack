Welcome to Haystack!
====================

Haystack provides modular search for Django. It features a unified, familiar
API that allows you to plug in different search backends (such as Solr_,
Elasticsearch_, Whoosh_, Xapian_, etc.) without having to modify your code.

.. _Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
.. _Elasticsearch: http://elasticsearch.org/
.. _Whoosh: https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/
.. _Xapian: http://xapian.org/


.. note::

    This documentation represents Haystack 2.x. For old versions of the documentation: `1.2`_, `1.1`_.

.. _`1.2`: http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/v1.2.6/index.html
.. _`1.1`: http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/v1.1/index.html
