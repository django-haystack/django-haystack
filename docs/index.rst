Welcome to Haystack!
====================

Haystack provides modular search for Django. It features a unified, familiar
API that allows you to plug in different search backends (such as Solr_,
Whoosh_, Xapian_, etc.) without having to modify your code.

.. _Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
.. _Whoosh: http://whoosh.ca/
.. _Xapian: http://xapian.org/

Requirements
------------

Haystack has a relatively easily-met set of requirements.

* Python 2.4+ (may work on 2.3 but untested)
* Django 1.0+

Additionally, each backend has its own requirements. You should refer to
:doc:`installing_search_engines` for more details.
