# Contributing

Haystack is open-source and, as such, grows (or shrinks) & improves in part
due to the community. Below are some guidelines on how to help with the project.

## Philosophy

-   Haystack is BSD-licensed. All contributed code must be either
    -   the original work of the author, contributed under the BSD, or...
    -   work taken from another project released under a BSD-compatible license.
-   GPL'd (or similar) works are not eligible for inclusion.
-   Haystack's git master branch should always be stable, production-ready &
    passing all tests.
-   Major releases (1.x.x) are commitments to backward-compatibility of the public APIs.
    Any documented API should ideally not change between major releases.
    The exclusion to this rule is in the event of either a security issue
    or to accommodate changes in Django itself.
-   Minor releases (x.3.x) are for the addition of substantial features or major
    bugfixes.
-   Patch releases (x.x.4) are for minor features or bugfixes.

## Guidelines For Reporting An Issue/Feature

So you've found a bug or have a great idea for a feature. Here's the steps you
should take to help get it added/fixed in Haystack:

-   First, check to see if there's an existing issue/pull request for the
    bug/feature. All issues are at https://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/issues
    and pull reqs are at https://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/pulls.
-   If there isn't one there, please file an issue. The ideal report includes:
    -   A description of the problem/suggestion.
    -   How to recreate the bug.
    -   If relevant, including the versions of your:
        -   Python interpreter
        -   Django
        -   Haystack
        -   Search engine used (as well as bindings)
        -   Optionally of the other dependencies involved
-   Ideally, creating a pull request with a (failing) test case demonstrating
    what's wrong. This makes it easy for us to reproduce & fix the problem.

    Github has a great guide for writing an effective pull request:
    https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request

    Instructions for running the tests are at
    https://django-haystack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_tests.html

You might also hop into the IRC channel (`#haystack` on `irc.freenode.net`)
& raise your question there, as there may be someone who can help you with a
work-around.

## Guidelines For Contributing Code

If you're ready to take the plunge & contribute back some code/docs, the
process should look like:

-   Fork the project on GitHub into your own account.
-   Clone your copy of Haystack.
-   Make a new branch in git & commit your changes there.
-   Push your new branch up to GitHub.
-   Again, ensure there isn't already an issue or pull request out there on it.
    If there is & you feel you have a better fix, please take note of the issue
    number & mention it in your pull request.
-   Create a new pull request (based on your branch), including what the
    problem/feature is, versions of your software & referencing any related
    issues/pull requests.

In order to be merged into Haystack, contributions must have the following:

-   A solid patch that:
    -   is clear.
    -   works across all supported versions of Python/Django.
    -   follows the existing style of the code base formatted with
        [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) and
        [`Black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) using the provided
        configuration in the repo
    -   comments included as needed to explain why the code functions as it does
-   A test case that demonstrates the previous flaw that now passes
    with the included patch.
-   If it adds/changes a public API, it must also include documentation
    for those changes.
-   Must be appropriately licensed (see [Philosophy](#philosophy)).
-   Adds yourself to the AUTHORS file.

If your contribution lacks any of these things, they will have to be added
by a core contributor before being merged into Haystack proper, which may take
substantial time for the all-volunteer team to get to.
