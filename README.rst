Haystack provides modular search for Django. It features a unified, familiar
API that allows you to plug in different search backends (such as Solr_,
Elasticsearch_, Whoosh_, Xapian_, etc.) without having to modify your code.

.. _Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
.. _Elasticsearch: http://elasticsearch.org/
.. _Whoosh: http://whoosh.ca/
.. _Xapian: http://xapian.org/

Haystack is BSD licensed, plays nicely with third-party app without needing to
modify the source and supports advanced features like faceting, More Like This,
highlighting, spatial search and spelling suggestions.
